# Quantum ML vs Classical ML Research

## Introduction

Quantum computing is anticipated to revolutionize the tech industry with its potential to tackle computational problems that are intractable for classical computers. Many speculate that quantum computers could offer advantages over classical computers in fields such as finance, machine learning, cryptography, chemistry, optimization, among others. This paper presents an experimental research conducted by Vanderbilt University personnels, comparing the performance of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to classical machine learning (ML) algorithms. It evaluates metrics such as precision score, recall score, F1 score, and runtime across multiple datasets. The research compared several classical machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF)—with quantum machine learning algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC), Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC), and Pegasos QSVC, using four different datasets. Then, a comprehensive analysis explored how the runtime of specific algorithms changed with the number of features and observations across the four datasets. This secondary analysis provided a direct comparison of models within the SVC family models (i.e., between classical SVC and QSVC algorithms). It also examined VQC to investigate potential trends pertaining to the relationship between runtime and number of features/observations.
